# yt-scraper

Modern YouTube scraper capable of retrieving video and channel info.

## Install

First install through NPM:

`npm install yt-scraper`

Then import into your project:

`const ytScraper = require("yt-scraper")`

## Usage

While the scraper will be updated as the YouTube video/channel page changes, all returned keys in objects described below should be treated as optional to avoid any errors causes by page changes.

### Raw Objects

This module works by scraping two sources of JSON data embedded in a YouTube HTML page. The first is named `ytInitialData` and contains components that make the page work, e.g. strings, related videos, keyboard shortcuts. The second is from the YouTube player which contains technical info about a video, e.g. runtime, name, privacy settings.

This data is long and mostly human unreadable which is why the module collects it all together and returns a single object. However if you need more information it is worth checking if that info is present in the raw data YouTube provides. This is possible by passing the `includeRawData` option to either video or channel info methods. When passed a new `raw` property is present in the returned object which contains both the page (`raw.page`) and player (`raw.player`, only present for video scraping) info.

As previously mentioned raw objects are long and ever changing therefore making it a futile task to document them, however it only takes a few minutes to look through an object if you need to.
